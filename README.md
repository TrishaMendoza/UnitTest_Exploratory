# UnitTest_Exploratory
Exploring various ways to compare ground truth from model predictions for spike trains and membrane potentials.

The following repository will contain all the methods I have attempted for comparisons of ground truth and predicted. This is an exploratory analysis, so I will be testing the strengths and weakness of different measures to see which one is the most effective at identifying whether the model was developed correctly. These tests will focus one spike train and membrane potential measures.
